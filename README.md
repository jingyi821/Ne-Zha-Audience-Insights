### **Ne Zha Audience Insights Dashboard**  

---

## **Project Overview**  

The **Ne Zha Audience Insights Dashboard** is an interactive visualization project that provides insights into the audience demographics, regional box office trends, and sentiment analysis based on user comments. This project leverages **Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and Pyecharts** to create a comprehensive dashboard with four key visualizations:  

- **Geo Map:** Displays the geographic distribution of fans across cities in China.  
- **Bar Chart:** Highlights the top 20 cities with the highest number of fans.  
- **Box Office Trends:** Presents an interactive time-series analysis of box office revenue across different regions.  
- **Word Cloud:** Visualizes the most common words in audience comments.  

The goal is to analyze how *Ne Zha* performed in various regions, where the audience engagement was highest, and what people were saying about the movie.
